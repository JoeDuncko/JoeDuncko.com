[Code Youngstown](https://codeyoungstown.com/) is an organization focused on connecting software engineers, developers, and coders in the Youngstown, OH area.

I've been helping out with Code Youngstown since 2017, and am very proud of the work we've done over the last 5 years.

I've decided to use this milestone as an excuse to document the history of the organization, with the hope that it could help position us for the next 5 years.

## History

### 2014 - 2016

Code Youngstown was started by Nicholas Serra (Nick) in 2014.

The first Code Youngstown event was an Open Hack Night held September 24th 2014 at the now defunct Nove Gatto Gallery in the Erie Terminal Building in downtown Youngstown.

I found out about the event through the [awesome posters](https://github.com/codeyoungstown/code-youngstown-assets/blob/master/event-fliers/CodeYoungstown-OpenHack.jpg) that were put up around YSU's Meshel Hall.

At the time I was pouring most of my effort putting together the first iteration of [HackYSU](/blog/hackysu-2022#past-events), and was very excited to hear of parallel efforts being taken by other Youngstownians to prop up our local tech scene.

The event was well attended - the ~30 guests included representatives from the YSU ACM (which I was vice-president of at the time), Drund, the Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI), YBI startups including Lightning Grader, and others.

Nick brought branded Code Youngstown swag - rubber bracelets, t-shirts, and stickers. It made the entire event seem so "real".

Because it was Code Youngstown's first event, Nick had everyone go around the room and introduce themselves. I remember very specifically that this was the coolest part of the meetup for me - it was a realization that people were actually doing tech in Youngstown, and that it had a future.

This gave me further confidence that putting on HackYSU was the "right thing".

The event ended with the creation of a Facebook page and Group to help everyone stay in touch.

A follow up event, dubbed a December Meetup, was held at the YBI December 16th 2014.

It too had an [awesome poster](https://github.com/codeyoungstown/code-youngstown-assets/blob/master/event-fliers/CodeYoungstown-December.jpg), which was shown off on Code Youngstown's [very first Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/323768151150675).

Unfortunately, this event had a much weaker showing - ~20 guests if I recall correctly - due to various things at play, including less time and resources put into marketing.

Subsequently, Code Youngstown went on an informal hiatus.

### 2017 - 2020

During the two year hiatus, Nick and I kept in touch. It helped that I was working at Drund, for whom Nick was doing contract work for at the time.

HackYSU 2015 went off without a hitch, and the team went to form the Youngstown Penguin Hackers (YPH) student organization to run it.

Work on YPH and HackYSU 2016 revealed the need for a hub for YPH alumni to continue to network together and potentially give back to YPH in the form of mentorship and corporate sponsorships.

A plan formed between Nick and I - and after HackYSU 2017 was held April 17th-19th 2017, we began efforts to revive Code Youngstown.

A [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Youngstown/) group was formed, the Facebook group was dropped in favor of [Slack](https://slack.codeyoungstown.com/), and an [official website](https://codeyoungstown.com/) was spun up.

A new format was created: we'd host events every other month - socials in the summer and winter, and tech-related talks for the rest.

The new format and tooling were inspired by my experience networking in the northeast Ohio area - namely PGH Code & Supply (a coworking space that maintains a Slack group, and hosts meetups and conferences), the now defunct Akron Launch League + Friends (a family of organizations that shared a Slack group with the goal of fostering a tech startup hub in Akron, hosted a conference called Launch League Flight before shuttering, closely tied to the OSC Tech Lab coworking space), and StartInCLE (a Slack group and monthly meetup for NEO-based startup founders, hosted a couple conferences).

Our first event was a set of tech talks at Drund - over 30 people showed (if I recall correctly) to hear [Mark Beacom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbeacom/), and [Adam Magana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammagana/) talk about Drund's tech stack.

Our second, a social at the YBI, exceeded all expectations and had over 40 guests (IIRC).

People were joining Slack and following us on Meetup. People were looking forward to our events. We had achieved some kind of community-market-fit.

In mid 2018 I started transitioning from Drund to working on my startup, so we decided to start changing things up and trying to have every event at a different tech-related place in Youngstown, to introduce people to organizations and businesses they otherwise would have never had the opportunity to interact with.

We were welcomed into Youngstown tech staples like the Oak Hill Collaborative, Turning Technologies, TBEIC (now Brite), and SenSource with open arms - and I'm very thankful to all of them for supporting us through the years.

You can see our [full event history over on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Youngstown/events/past/).

Things slowed down at the end of 2019. I was exhausted - my startup was failing, contract work wasn't paying the bills, and Code Youngstown got put on the back burner.

Then COVID hit. It felt like everything - including tech conferences and events - were going remote, and we didn't feel like we could compete. And so, Code Youngstown went on another hiatus.

### 2021 - today

We didn't feel comfortable hosting any Code Youngstown events summer 2021 - after vaccines were widely available.

Our first event was held in Mill Creek Park, outside. From there, we started having our events at Westside Bowl, whose high ceilings and conservative COVID policies made us feel comfortable continuing to host events.

We were able to have a handful of events before the seasons changed and COVID picked up again.

It's now summer 2022, and we are trying to get a handful of events in at Westside before COVID picks up again (assuming it does).

## Future

I think Code Youngstown has the potential to contribute to the Youngstown tech community beyond our events and Slack group.

Currently, a lot of the value of Code Youngstown is currently locked inside of Slack. For example, the job listings that are shared in the #jobs channel. A public job board possibly modeled off of Code & Supply's) might help make that value more accessible.

One other thing that is currently locked behind Slack is the ability to find local talent for contract work. I'm not sure if it'd take the form of a reverse job board or what, but having a public directory of local individuals and firms avaliable for contract work would SOMETHING

Speaking of directories, one project I've been working on is a list of local companies that employ technologists (LINK). I'd also like to grow that into something that could be public facing.

The reverse might also be cool - to set up a set of Built in Youngstown branding and directory of projects and digital products built in Youngstown (like Built in CLE).

I also think that Code Youngstown can serve as a platform for local software engineers to share their stories. The Code Youngstown Podcast (ADD LINK) was a great first shot at this - I've love to see that revived, or something else take its place - maybe a collaborative blog?

That leaves two elephants in the room: a conference and a coworking space.

Conference

I strongly believe that Youngstown needs a physical tech-oriented coworking space.
