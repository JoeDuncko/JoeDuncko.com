This month, [Dev Youngstown](https://www.youngstown.dev/) celebrates its official one year anniversary.

A lot of confusion around what it is, who it is, etc.

## Naming

Up front, I want to address that despite the similarity in naming, Dev Youngstown LLC is owned by me, and operates separately from [Code Youngstown](https://codeyoungstown.com/), which is currently a purely social project funded by Nick Serra and I out of pocket.

However, Dev Youngstown does donate (read as: covers the cost of) developer time to Code Youngstown, as our students maintain the Code Youngstown website, Job Board, and Directory.

## Background

I remember Nick Serra and I having conversations about what it might be like if Youngstown had a "Dev Shop" as far back as 2017.

The conversation grew out of our frustration at the lack of companies building "real apps" in the Youngstown area.

meant that there were few opportunities for students to get internships, no one for us to refer people to

Lack of upwards (or sideways) mobility

At the time, Nick worked part time at Drund, where I interned.

Drund itself evolved from [YDEK Productions](https://ydekproductions.com/), a web development firm that brought business to Youngstown - and while there are plenty of dev-capable marketing firms in the youngstown area, doing the same, no one focused on app development specifically. It's always an add on to marketing services.

Students - get them started, internships etc

- Inspired by Drund

However, Nick dismissed it as a "retirement gig", and I definitely didn't have the time, so that's where it sat.

## Beginnings Ryan, then Garrett and Trong

Ryan, remaking Code Youngstown's site

Ryan Lalchand, a former HackYSU organizer, graduated Youngstown State University in May 2022. Unable to find a job, I tried connecting him with a YBI-associated startup.

This was a connection that was a perfect fit on paper, but the startup struggled to onboard and make effective use of Ryan.

I was frustrated - if Ryan couldn't find a way to pay rent with programming, he'd need to look outside the industry. I had seen that before - and often it led to people never having their break into the industry.

Cooincidentally, I had recently received a solid salary bump at BlastPoint, and was contemplating on how best to utilize the money to improve my quality of life. I had also recently written [my blog post on Code Youngstown](/blog/code-youngstown-a-retrospective), which ends by pitching a couple projects that would possibly move the needle for Youngstown's developer community - a job board and a directory of organization that employ technologists. I was also experimenting with the idea of delegating, something I didn't have much experience with at the time.

It ended up adding up to me funding Ryan's rewrite of the Code Youngstown website in Next.js, where he added the initial implementations of the Job Board and Directory, now Code Youngstown staple resources.

By July Ryan had successfully found a software engineering role, and passed his responsibilities to Garrett Huggins - a student I had met at HackYSU in April who happened to be building his first Next.js site at the event.

In parallel, conversations with the original startup continued. They had secured some funding and wanted to have something built. By that time, Garrett and I had formed a solid working relationship, and he had an interest in taking the project on. Concerned about continuity, I asked Garrett if he knew anyone interested in backend development. By September, we had onboarded Trong Ong to working on the Code Youngstown site.

It took some time to iron out the details - during which, Garrett and Trong were super patient with me - but plans solidified by December, and work on our first project began in January 2023.
