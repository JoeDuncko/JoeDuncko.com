This month, [Dev Youngstown](https://www.youngstown.dev/) celebrates its official one year anniversary.

A lot of confusion around what it is, who it is, etc.

## Naming

Up front, I want to address that despite the similarity in naming, Dev Youngstown LLC is owned by me, and operates separately from [Code Youngstown](https://codeyoungstown.com/), which is currently a purely social project funded by Nick Serra and I out of pocket.

However, Dev Youngstown does donate (read as: covers the cost of) developer time to Code Youngstown, as our students maintain the Code Youngstown website, Job Board, and Directory.

## Background

I remember Nick Serra and I having conversations about what it might be like if Youngstown had a "Dev Shop" as far back as 2017. At the time, Nick worked part time at Drund,

Drund itself evolved from [YDEK Productions](https://ydekproductions.com/)

YDEK brought business to Youngstown - and while there are plenty of dev-capable marketing firms in the youngstown area, doing the same, no one focused on app development specifically. It's always an add on to marketing services.

Students - get them started, internships etc

- Inspired by Drund
  Nick and I

However, Nick dismissed it as a "retirement gig", and I definitely didn't have the time, so that's where it sat.
